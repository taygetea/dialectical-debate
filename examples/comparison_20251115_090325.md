## Passage Under Analysis

When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of his home, and went into the mountains.

## Branch Questions

### Generic Detection
**Question:** Does the text's meaning reside in what it explicitly states or in the interpretive frameworks it activates in readers?

### Observer Detection: The Phenomenologist
**Bias:** Only first-person lived experience is primary; everything else is derivative
**Question:** What is the phenomenal quality of the rupture itself—the felt experience of the moment when "home" transitions from being the lived center of one's experiential world to something that can be left?

## Differentiation Analysis

```json
{
  "question_similarity": 0.05,
  "question_differentiation": 0.95,
  "new_concepts_generic": 14,
  "new_concepts_observer": 24,
  "introduces_more_novelty": true
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- Jaccard similarity < 0.4 = substantively different questions ✓
- Jaccard similarity 0.4-0.6 = somewhat different
- Jaccard similarity > 0.6 = similar questions (observer may be reformulating)

## Depth Analysis

## Manual Assessment Checklist

### 1. Traceability
Can you clearly see the observer's bias ("Only first-person lived experience is primary; everything else is derivative") in the question?

- [ ] Yes, the question directly reflects the observer's bias
- [ ] Partially, some elements of the bias are present
- [ ] No, the question doesn't reflect the stated bias

**Notes:**


### 2. Surprise
Would generic detection have found this question?

- [ ] No, this is a genuinely different angle
- [ ] Maybe, it's related but distinct
- [ ] Yes, it's essentially a reformulation

**Notes:**


### 3. Productivity
Which branch debate generated more interesting insights?

- [ ] Observer branch was more interesting
- [ ] Generic branch was more interesting
- [ ] Both equally interesting
- [ ] Both equally uninteresting

**Notes:**


### 4. Integration
Which merge-back enrichment was more valuable?

**Generic enrichment excerpt:**
The branch resolution reveals that Nietzsche's opening sentence operates simultaneously across all three dimensions: it makes an explicit claim (a man departed at thirty), activates deep psychological...

**Observer enrichment excerpt:**
The branch exploration reveals that Zarathustra's departure operates simultaneously across all three registers the debaters identified: it is a literal geographical movement *and* a psychological indi...

- [ ] Observer enrichment added more value
- [ ] Generic enrichment added more value
- [ ] Both comparable

**Notes:**


## Conclusion

**Success Criteria Check (Phase 1):**
- [ ] Observer question is substantively different (Jaccard < 0.4)
- [ ] Observer question traces to stated bias (manual check)
- [ ] Technical functionality works without errors

**Recommendation:**
- [ ] Observer approach is promising, proceed with testing other personas
- [ ] Observer needs refinement (strengthen bias, adjust examples)
- [ ] Try different observer persona for this passage type
